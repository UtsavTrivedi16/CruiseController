1) Are we assuming we will always get inputs for Valued Signals or inputs for the 1st tick atleast

We found that program does not work if we dont provide any inputs initially

2) Do we assume quick accel/decel are not present in same tick? If so what is the expected behaviour

Our Program : First handles quick decel and then handles quick accel

3)Can the ouput from the top module be fed into a submodules

We have done this
Alternative
Use a Sync Variables in top module

4)What if the set is pressed and and quick accel/decel in same tick

Correct Assumption:Current Solution
present(set) then

---set current speed -> CruiseSpeed

else
--Handle other inputs


end present;



5) Do we set CruiseSpeed to Vehicle Speed each time Cruise State goes from 
   OFF to ON or only the first time |A

Correct Assumption: Our solution -> Every time we go from OFF to ON


assign CruiseSpeed := Speed





1) check if speed<desired and not increasing keep driving

Things to add

Strong Abort for Brake and maybe Traps
Copy Over function again and change input data typec


abort 

 // Body will be executed

when isBrakePressed



end abort 

 More questions

 When is the Speed Legal 
 a.min<speed<max 
 or
 b.min<= speed<= max

 Our Solution: b


 MORE questions

1. Throtle 
 our Soln 
 If ON _> use functions

 or just use accel

 TEST #40,42 Ask Nathan 
 # Test 40:In DISABLE: Set,
  should set CruiseSpeed and go to ON(no aceel and legal speed

  Our Soln: Basically state transition to ON 
  then Set will trigger

# Test 42:In ON: Set, and QuickAccel.
Set is strong priority( other buttons not executed), 
Quick Accel will not get checked
